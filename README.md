# Ubuntu-Configurations

This repository is created as a quick reference for Ubuntu commands and common notes / configurations. Each file contains a source from where I pulled the information from and will continue to grow as I learn more about Ubuntu and navigating around the OS.

Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS & 19.04
