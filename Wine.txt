Install Wine 4.13 in Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 19.04

1. Open terminal either via Ctrl+Alt+T keyboard shortcut or by searching for ‘terminal’ from application menu. When it opens,
run following commands to download and install the key:

> wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key && sudo apt-key add winehq.key

2. Then add Wine repository for Ubuntu 19.04:

> sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ disco main'

2a. For other Ubuntu releases, replace disco in the code with:

> bionic for Ubuntu 18.04, Linux Mint 19.x

3. Install unmet dependence: faudio
The wine devel package requires libfaudio0 library which is not available in Ubuntu repositories.
As a workaround, run command to add the third-party PPA, which offers the packages for Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 19.04.

> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cybermax-dexter/sdl2-backport

4. Finally run command to install Wine 4.13, which will automatically install the required libfaudio0 libraries.

> sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-devel

5. Once installed, run "winecfg" to bring up the configuration window and check Wine version.
